    <p class="about-content">

        You bring with you everything that makes India so uniquely Indian: the rich culture, the poetic art, the aromatic food, and the engaging people. You bring with you the power of meditation, the Yoga and the Ayurveda, the Taj Mahal and the Gateway of India, Bollywood films and the Bachchans, the Ambassadors and Auto-Rickshaws, the IPL and the Tendulkar, the Akbar and the Birbal, the Sitar and the Tabla. You bring with you Raaga, Nritya, Natya, the politics, the weddings, one thousand dialects, 300 different ways of cooking the potato, and yet you bring with you the power of a single identity.
        <br/>
        <br/> We at Association of Indian Students indulge in everything Indian you bring, and locate amidst our diversities what we all have in common. We dance away to desi beats, splash colors on our faces, gulp those gol gappas off a saucer, sing the national anthem, and watch with bated breath as Dhoni smashes that last ball into the stands. And until the summons from home becomes too loud to ignore, we keep you connected to your roots.
        <br/>
        <br/> Come, let us recapture that thrill that runs through each of us when we think of home.
        <br/> Welcome to the Association of Indian Students at the University of Southern California.
